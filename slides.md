# Why Nix?

## Problems

- Discrepancies across multiple machines
- Multiple language versions (Java, Node, Haskell, Go)
- Shared global libraries (glibc, musl)
- Security
- Unmaintained open source projects
- Running one thing in dev and another in prod
- Building the same package many times
- N+1 package managers
